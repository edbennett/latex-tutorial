For BSc projects and other courses, as well as in research, you will need to
produce academic posters presenting your work. LaTeX has classes and packages
to assist with this; however, some of the beauty of LaTeX's automatic layout
is lost with these, due to the very different requirements of laying out text
on such a large canvas.

For this reason we will generally want to work with a pre-prepared layout and
design for a poster. While the `a0poster` class comes built into LaTeX, you could
consider using Brian Amberg's `baposter` class, which can be found
[here](http://www.brian-amberg.de/uni/poster/). Various example posters are included
which you can base your own design around.

Whatever class you use, you should look up how to set the paper size; for BSc projects
and other assessed posters we will be using A1 sized posters, while for conference
poster sessions you more frequently want A0 sized posters.
